A (currently incomplete) Chicken Scheme wrapper around the [libnova library](http://libnova.sourceforge.net/index.html) which is "a general purpose, double precision, Celestial Mechanics, Astrometry and Astrodynamics library" available under the GNU LPGL.


####### Notes

If chicken-install fails to find libnova, "export CSC_OPTIONS='-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib'" may help.
